  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hip_hop_music">Hip hop music and movement</a> was born in the poor districts of New York by Afro-American and Latin teenagers in the 70's.<br />
  In Hip hop music the drums beats are usually played by electronic instruments or plug-ins, with samples of drumming beats and drum breaks taken from the great Rhythm'n'Blues and Funk tradition.<br /> When a drummer plays hip hop drums beats, he has to look for the right sound and the right groove, and in many cases he can add to his drum kit some electronic pads, as in this Hip hop drum kit version of the virtual drums.
  Play Hip hop beats for drums in real time along to your favorite songs with Hip hop virtual drum kit by touching the screen or with your PC keyboard, pressing the keys corresponding to the drum kit elements, snare drum, bass drum, toms.<br />
  <br />
  Hip hop drumkit and virtual drum kits all require <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/First_steps/What_is_JavaScript">Javascript</a> enabled.
